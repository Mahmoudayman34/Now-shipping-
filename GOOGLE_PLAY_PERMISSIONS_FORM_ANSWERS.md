## All files access (MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)

### Describe 1 feature in your app that requires a permitted use of the All files access permission

**Excel Financial Report Export Feature**

Our shipping management app includes a critical business feature that allows users to export financial data (cash cycles, transactions, and wallet reports) to Excel files. When users export these financial reports, the app needs to save the Excel files directly to the device's Downloads folder so users can access them for accounting, record-keeping, and financial analysis purposes. This feature is essential for business users who need to maintain financial records and share reports with accountants or financial advisors. The All files access permission is required because the app must write Excel files to the Downloads directory, which requires broad storage access on Android 11+ devices.

### Why does your app need to use the All files access permission? Select all that apply:

- ✅ **Core functionality**

### Technical reason

Our app cannot use more privacy-friendly alternatives like the Storage Access Framework (SAF) or Media Store API for the following reasons:

1. **Direct Downloads Folder Access**: Business users need Excel files saved directly to the Downloads folder for easy access and sharing. The Storage Access Framework requires users to manually navigate and select a save location each time, which disrupts the workflow for users who frequently export financial reports.

2. **File Format Limitations**: The Excel files (.xlsx) generated by our backend API are binary files that need to be saved with their original format intact. While SAF can handle file saving, it doesn't provide the seamless user experience needed for a business application where users export reports multiple times daily.

3. **Background Processing**: Our app processes financial data from the server and immediately saves it to Downloads. Using SAF would require interrupting the user workflow with a file picker dialog every time they export a report, which is not acceptable for a business-critical feature that needs to work efficiently.

4. **User Expectations**: Business users expect exported financial reports to appear in their Downloads folder automatically, similar to how desktop applications work. This is a core expectation for financial management tools.

5. **Integration Requirements**: The exported Excel files are often used with other business tools (accounting software, spreadsheets) that expect files in standard locations like Downloads. The Media Store API is designed for media files, not business documents like Excel spreadsheets.

## Photo and Video Permissions

### Read media images (READ_MEDIA_IMAGES)

**Describe your app's use of the READ_MEDIA_IMAGES permission:**

Our shipping management app uses the READ_MEDIA_IMAGES permission for two core business features:

1. **Profile Picture Upload**: Users can select and upload profile pictures from their device gallery to personalize their business profile. This is essential for business identity and professional appearance in the shipping management platform.

2. **Document Upload for Business Registration**: During the business profile completion process, users must upload identification documents (ID cards, business licenses, company registration documents) and brand type documentation. These documents are required for account verification and business onboarding. Users need to select multiple images from their gallery to complete their business profile setup, which is a mandatory step for using the platform.

The permission is used frequently as users may update their profile pictures and businesses may need to submit additional documentation during account verification or profile updates.

### Read media video (READ_MEDIA_VIDEO)

**Describe your app's use of the READ_MEDIA_VIDEO permission:**

Our app uses the READ_MEDIA_VIDEO permission to support document upload functionality during business profile completion. While primarily used for image documents, the permission ensures compatibility when users need to upload video-based documentation (such as video verification materials or business demonstration videos) as part of their business registration process. Additionally, this permission provides future-proofing for potential features where video documentation may be required for enhanced business verification or order-related evidence (such as delivery confirmation videos or return item condition videos). The permission is requested to ensure a seamless user experience when accessing media files during the document upload workflow.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure your AndroidManifest.xml properly declares these permissions (which it does)
- The app should handle permission requests gracefully with clear explanations
- Consider adding in-app explanations before requesting permissions
- Test the permission flows on Android 11+ devices to ensure proper behavior
